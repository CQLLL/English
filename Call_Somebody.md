- Hello. Is Mike there, please?
- Would you tell him Tom called?
- Could I speak to Miss Green?
- I called to ask if you are available tonight.
- She's not here. Who is calling, please?

- I'm not sure if you can help me, but I'm trying to reach Vincent Bianchi.

- You got him.

- Oh, OK. Wow. I wasn't expecting this... Um...I thought I was gonna have to leave a message.

- You wanna call back? I could let the machine pick up.

- No! No, no. No. OK, Mr.Bianchi, I am a really big fan of yours. That cover shoot you did for Rolling Stone... Wow, that was amazing.

- Thank you. You have excellent taste. How can help you?

- Well, I'm calling about your availability for a magazine shoot.

- You gotta go through my rep for that, Sheila Cordova.

- You know, you and I, we went to the same high school!

- Huh?

- Queensborough High, right? Class of 93?

Bianchi:Bi
Betty:Be

Be:No, no, no. We didn't go at the same time.
Actually, my name is Betty Suarez. Class of 2002. But,
it turns out that you and me, we grew up four blocks from each other. I live of Roosevelt.

Bi:You're a Jackson Heights girls, huh?

Be:Uh-huh.

Bi:You don't say.

Be:I practically live at Astoria Lemon Ice. You know that doughnut place two blocks down? That's where I grew up. I worked there every summer in high school and 
it burnt down. Now it's a deli. It's pretty good, but...

Bi:Not as good as SaI's though,huh?

Be:On 87th? Oh, my gosh, like the best sausage and pepper hero on the eastern seaboard.

Bi:Just the smell of those could get me high. I haven't thought about those in a long time. So, Betty Suarez, OK, you've got me hungry and curious. What is this job wanted to talk to me about?

Be:Well, I work at Mode magazine and my boss, Daniel Meade, was wondering ... Hello?

You don't say. (表示惊讶)不会吧，真的啊，我不觉得那奇怪。


## 委婉提出意见

I beg to differ with you. 请允许我表示异议。
I'm afraid you are mistaken here. 恐怕你在这一点上弄错了。
May I contradict you on this point?在这点上我的看法和你的相反
My feeling is that you ought to take the chance.我觉得你应该去碰碰运气

If I were you, I'd take a break right away.如果我是你，我会马上去休息
